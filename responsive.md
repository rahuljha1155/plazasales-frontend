## Responsive Design Guidelines (Large Screens / Desktop)

For lg screen sizes and above (lg:):

- Use vw units for text sizes (e.g., lg:text-[0.75vw], lg:text-[0.85vw], lg:text-[2.4vw], lg:text-[3.2vw]), paddings, margins, gaps, button dimensions, and rounded borders.
- _Do NOT_ constrain main containers or text blocks with fixed max-w-\* classes (such as max-w-4xl, max-w-6xl, max-w-7xl, max-w-xl, container-custom, etc.).
- Use w-full lg:max-w-none or w-full lg:max-w-[90vw] according to its width in xl, 2xl, 3xl, 4xl, 5xl, 6xl, 7xl and fluid padding px-4 sm:px-8 lg:px-[5vw] on outer section containers so elements scale fluidly across wide viewports and zoom levels without shrinking into narrow boxes.
